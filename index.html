                <h2 id="note_title">A Message to my One and Only</h2>
                <p id="note_message">Emily, I wanted to do something nice for you because I love you so much (more), so I spent some time to make this webpage. I know its not perfect and it looks kinda bad so I am sorry. But I hope it is the thought that counts. I want to keep this webpage as a place to remember all of the good times we have, especially to look back at when we get older.
                I also wanted to start of with a message to you, one that I can update as time goes on. I love you so so so so so so so much and I am so lucky to have you in my life. I don't know what I would do without you and you really are so special to me. There is no one like you in the entire world. I am so grateful for everything you do for me and for you just being here.
                I really couldn't ask for more in my future wife. To start, you really are the most kind person I have ever meant. You have a huge heart and are always willing to help. You are so caring and loving to everyone around you, especially me. You put other before you and I really admire that. Although there is always some small issues, you are very family oriented.
                You love your family so much and I love that about you. You will be a great mom and wife in the future. You are incredibly smart and ambitious. You take your passions and fly away with them and make them something that is useful not only for you but for the world. Your smarts are something that I am super jealous of.
                I have worked my whole life to try to be as smart as possible and you exceed me in every way. You are also very beautiful. I love your smile more than anything. To this day seeing you smile at me still gives me butterflies and I love it so much. Your eyes are mesmorizing, you hair is gorgeous, and the rest of you is absolutely perfect.
                I love absolutely everything about you and I would never change a thing. You are my perfect match and I am beyond lucky to have you in my life, especially as my one and only. I hope this message conveys even the smallest amount of my love for you, but there really isn't enough words in the world to descirbe just how much I actually love you.
                I love you so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so much (more) Emily. You are my Earth, Moon, and Sun. I cannot wait to spend the rest of my life by your side. Thank you for being youself and continuing to be the most amazing girlfriend I could ever ask for and loving me so dearly. I love you forever and always.
                - Keith

                        <p>This was our second time seeing each other ever. It was my first time in New York City on a class trip and you persuaded your family to bring you both of the days I was there which I am very grateful for.
                        We first met up at Lombardi's and I was very excited to see you again. We spent both of the days entirely together and I tried to get out of doing the things I didn't want to so I could hangout with you.
                        I also may have broken some of the school rules when going out late a night to walk you to the train station and other things as well but it was all worth it when in the end about 10 minutes before your mom picked you up I asked you to be my girlfriend.
                        I love you so much.</p>

                        <p>You made it to the family vacation! Our three month anniversary was during this trip. Im so happy that you could come and your parents were good with going as well.
                            Our families met for the first time and got along very well. You stayed in our place because your parents were camping.
                            Unfortunately you were on your period the entire time so we couldn't do as much as we wanted to but we still had a great time.
                            I love you so much.</p>

                        <p>After the third week of college, your parents, great aunt, and grandma came up to Rochester to see you for your 18th birthday! They stayed for the weekend and I ended up hanging out with you guys.
                            The first day we went to go get tacos and went to some of the parks around Rochester. Then we went to RIT and you gave your dad and grandma a tour.
                            The next day we went to Niagara Falls and had an amazing time. We went on the Maid of the Mist, I got you a duck with a poncho, and we ate at the Top of the Falls.
                            I love you so much.
